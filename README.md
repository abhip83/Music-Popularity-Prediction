# Music-Popularity-Prediction
This project implements a machine learning–based approach to predict music popularity using audio and metadata features.

Description

This project predicts the popularity of music tracks using machine learning techniques. Audio and metadata features are analyzed to train a regression model capable of estimating a song’s popularity score.

The project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
